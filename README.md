# üçî bigmac alpha builds

Big Sur macOS 11 Mac Pro patcher. Update source code to download MacOS 11.4

Spaces are being corrected in the current source code. A few changes are being made on June 18, 2021.

There is a known issue with PCIe SSD Cards on 11.3.2 and later. My workaround is to put the SSD card in your primary video card 16x slot (on a Mac Pro 3,1) and put the Video Card in the upper 16x slot. You will lose 1 PCIe slot depending on the width of your video card. Your mileage may vary. Untested with NVMe cards. I don't have one, but I did run into PCIe problems with the video card in it's primary slot. You may be able to do the same in a 5,1, but it's PCIe configuration is not the same as a 3,1. However I think there is a told that lets you adjust the bandwidth of certain PCIe slots on a 5,1 and that might help. Just a wild guess.
